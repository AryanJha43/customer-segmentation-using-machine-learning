# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

A retailer has engaged us to help create customer clusters—also known as "customer segments"—using a data-driven approach.

They have provided a dataset containing past transaction-level purchase data.  
Our objective is to build a clustering model based on this dataset.

The model should consider both overall sales patterns and specific products purchased by customers.

This project applies **Unsupervised Learning** techniques.

The input dataset can be found in the `Files` folder.

The complete code, including data analysis and clustering using the K-Means algorithm, is available in the Jupyter Notebook.
